# MiloGDPS
This Is My New GDPS Only Available For Windows
# Installation
First, Download The Latest Release From [Here](https://github.com/miledhomairah/MiloGDPS/blob/main/MiloGDPS.torrent)

Next, Extract The Torrent File (Recommended To Extract Using [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)), And Make Sure You Have Already Earlier Bought GD, As This Version Only Is The Modded Version, Some Software Are Needed For It To Run

Finally, Open the Folder, Then Geometry Dash Blaze (I Named It Like That Because The Files Weren't Detecting MiloGDPS), And Voilla!
